# NextGen
Conditional Rendering:
Ensured that the Home, HomeCollections, and PolicyAndSubscribe components are hidden when navigating to the /signin or /signup routes by adding conditional rendering logic.

Modular Code Design:
Introduced a separate AppContent component to manage conditional rendering for better code readability and maintainability.

Dynamic Route Detection:
Used useLocation from react-router-dom to dynamically detect the current route and render content accordingly.

Consistent Navigation Experience:
Ensured that the Navbar and Footer remain consistent across all routes, improving user experience.

Scalable Structure:
Organized components and routing logic to make it easier to add new pages or features in the future.

Enhanced Readability:
Cleaned up the JSX structure and removed unnecessary comments, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

These changes ensure a polished, user-friendly, and scalable application. Let me know if you'd like further enhancements!
